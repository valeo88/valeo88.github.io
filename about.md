# About me and contacts

My name is Valentin Popov. I finished physics faculty in Lomonosov Moscow State University in 2012.
My way as a software developer began in 2012 with the development
of a small program to help process the data of an application company
for material and technical resources for JSC Gazprom. For 8 years, I was able to go from
a junior developer to a senior, developing fairly large information systems
from scratch and putting them into commercial operation.
